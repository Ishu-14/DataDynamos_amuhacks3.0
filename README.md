## **ABSTRACT**
This research investigates the effectiveness of contextual embeddings for sentiment analysis specifically tailored for Twitter data, presenting a comprehensive comparative study within the domain of Natural Language Processing (NLP). The study encompasses a diverse range of contextual embedding models to capture the intricate nuances and sentiments prevalent in the informal and dynamic nature of Twitter communication. Through rigorous experimentation and evaluation, we meticulously assess the performance metrics such as accuracy, robustness,
and computational efficiency of these models in sentiment analysis tasks.
The comparative analysis provides invaluable insights into the strengths and limitations of different contextual embeddings, shedding light on their applicability and effectiveness in understanding and analyzing sentiments expressed in social media discourse. Our findings contribute significantly to advancing the field of NLP by offering a detailed evaluation framework for contextual embeddings, thus facilitating informed decisions in choosing appropriate techniques for sentiment analysis in social media data. This research bridges the gap between theoretical advancements and practical applicability, providing a solid foundation for enhancing sentiment analysis methodologies tailored for the complex and expressive
context of Twitter.
