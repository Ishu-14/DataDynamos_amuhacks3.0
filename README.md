# Preprocessing Techniques and Semantic Analysis

Preprocessing refers to the initial steps taken to prepare raw data for further analysis, while semantic analysis interprets the meaning of text.

## Preprocessing Techniques:

1. **Tokenization:** Breaking text into smaller units like words or phrases.
2. **Stemming and Lemmatization:** Reducing words to their root form.
3. **Named Entity Recognition (NER):** Identifying entities like names, locations, etc.
4. **Part-of-Speech Tagging:** Assigning grammatical categories to words.
5. **Text Clustering and Classification:** Grouping similar documents or assigning categories.
6. **Topic Modeling:** Identifying themes within a collection of documents.

## Semantic Analysis:

Understanding the logical meaning behind words, phrases, and sentences. It's crucial for tasks like sentiment analysis.

# Sentiment Analysis and Model Selection

Sentiment analysis involves interpreting the emotional tone of text, while model selection is about choosing the right algorithm or model for analysis.

## Sentiment Labeling:

Assigning sentiment values to text, which can be positive, negative, or neutral.

## Model Selection:

Choosing appropriate algorithms or models like rule-based, machine learning, pre-trained, or ensemble methods.

# Sentiment Analysis Techniques and Model Evaluation

Different techniques are used for sentiment analysis, and model evaluation assesses the performance of trained models.

## Sentiment Analysis Techniques:

## Confusion Matrix / Result Analysis:
Confusion matrix basically is a fundamental tool that can be used by importing the confusion_matrix from sklearn.metrics library in python it is used to visualize the model performance in a table like format by comparing the predictions of the model with the actual values.

Confusion matrix usually consists of four components respectively as listed below:

<img width="674" alt="Screenshot 2024-04-27 at 11 01 38 AM" src="https://github.com/Ishu-14/DataDynamos_amuhacks3.0/assets/115252211/23bcc47f-6d6f-4626-9c01-51557719ecff">

These four values are used for the purpose of analyzing the performance of model as to calculate various performance measures:  Accuracy, Recall, Precision, F1 Score that provides the insights about how well our model is fitted and is performing, hence confusion matrix is useful to analyze that where our model is lacking or making errors and helps us to fine-tune the model for better performance.

### Accuracy: accuracy is the total fraction of  correctly predicted classes versus the total predictions done by model, maximum value of  accuracy can be 1 and minimum value can be 0,
accuracy is represented as:

                                                                Accuracy=  (TP+TN)/(TP+TN+FP+FN)                                                     (4)
### Precision: positive pre

                                                                 Precision=  TP/(TP+ FP)                                                              (5)


### Recall: Also known as true positive rate (TPR)
                                                                       Recall =  TP/(TP+ FN)                                                              (6)

### F1 Score: F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, it maintains the balance between precision and recall, value lies between[0,1] formula is inscribed below.
                                                       F1 Score =  (2*(precision * recall))/((precision + recall))                                                      (7)
